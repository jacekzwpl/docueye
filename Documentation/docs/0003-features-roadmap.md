# Feature roadmap

DocuEye is still work in progress. Below You can see features that I am going to implement. Order of features is not important.

### Features on roadmap

| Feature | Description | 
| ---- | ------ |
| Styling elements | Element styles are supported but not every feature that can be found in structurizr dsl is. Currently: <br /> Shapes are icons (Shapes that does no effect Box,RoundedBox,Circle,Ellipse,Cylinder,Pipe) <br /> If shape is defined icon does no effect <br /> Width and height does no effect. <br /> In future I want to support  these features. |
| Relationship Styles | Currently: properties position, dashed and routing does no effect. In future I want to support  these properties. |
| Manual layout saving | Currently you can move diagram elements and export diagram to png for some presentation or workshop. In some cases especially when working with larger number of elements in one diagram it can be useful to save manual layout in DocueEye |
